# TwitterBot

This will automatically reply to selected tweets.

Please note that this should not be used for spamming, as it violates Twitter's policies and can result in the suspension of your Twitter account.

Prerequisites:
<ul><li>
A Twitter developer account</li><li>
Tweepy and Python 2.7 or higher installed on your device.</ul>

To install Tweepy, download it from this link: 

<a href="https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy">Tweepy</a>

Next, obtain developer keys from your Twitter account and replace them in the designated keys file. You can then customize the tweet reply message by editing the "Merry Christmas" phrase in the twitterBot.py file.

Finally, run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:

python3 filename.py

Hope these instructions will help you get started with implementing an automatic tweet reply system using Python and Tweepy.
